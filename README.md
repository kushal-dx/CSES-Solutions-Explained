# CSES Solutions Explained

This repository contains my solutions to problems from the **CSES Problem Set**, with detailed explanations of my **thought process**, **algorithms**, and any **tricky or edge cases** involved.

For each problem, I explain:
- How I approached the problem
- The key observations and ideas
- The algorithms and data structures used
- Important optimizations and pitfalls to avoid

I created this repository primarily to **track my learning** and to clearly document **how I think through problems step by step**. The goal is not just to present solutions, but to show the **reasoning behind them**.

Readers can use these explanations to better understand how to analyze problems and develop efficient solutions. I hope this repository helps others learn something new about **problem-solving and algorithms**.
